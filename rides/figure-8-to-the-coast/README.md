# Figure 8 to the Coast

- **Miles:** 287
- **Duration:** 7.5 hours (6 hours drive time)

This ride will take you into the Coastal Range, Tillamook and Clatsop State
Forests and it will take you near a number of Wildlife Refuge areas and Elk
View points. This is a good one day ride that can have you slurping clam
chowder at the beach and braving the mighty Columbia in an open ferry boat. The
roads are both technical twisty and sweepers. There is a lot to see, as usual
here in the PNW, and you should allow for a number of 20 minute stops to
observe the scenery.

If Hwy 202 were smoother, it would be as good as it gets with countless
repetitive turns and forced rhythm leaning from side to side, but it's
interrupted by the rough road. Enjoy it at a slower speed. It's a Top 20 Twisty
Road.
